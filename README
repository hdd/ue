1. About

   Ue is a simple asset management and pipeline system for film and vfx.
   It's intended for small, individual projects and ease of setup. It's
   not database backed, instead using python dictionaries in text files
   to store metadata.

   Ue should be treated as Beta software right now!

2. Design

   Ue describes elements. Each element describes one set of files, e.g.
   one comp script or one sequence of rendered images. Each element
   contains incremental versions of the files.

   An element is described like so:

   > project:group:asset:name:type:class

   * Projects i.e. a film
   * Groups i.e. a sequence
   * Assets are the working base of the pipeline, where applications
     can be launched from and elements saved to i.e. a shot
   * Classes describe what the element it i.e. a comp script, a
     rendered image sequence
   * Types describe what the element is in the context of the asset
   * Name is the specific name of the element

   An element string is a like an absolute file path - it needs to be
   unique. However, an individual project/group/asset/name/type/class
   string is like a file or directory name - it only needs to be
   unique within its parent.

3. Setup

   1) Edit ue_env_setup

      Change UE_PATH to the absolute path of the ue source root.

   2) Source ue_env_setup

      In your .bashrc, put a line like this:

      source ~/Code/ue/ue_env_setup

   3) Run ./ue_setup

      This will set up a bin directory in the source root with a bunch of symlinks..

   4) Edit the paths in src/wrapper to match your applications

   That's it!

More coming soon...
